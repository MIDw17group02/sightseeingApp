# sightseeingApp

This Android Application is developed for the 'Mobile Interaction Design Labor' winter term 17/18.
This learning module is taking place at the Leibniz University of Hanover.

Our main goal is to gain knowledge over the UI interaction of mobile applications.
Especially the interaction with a smartphone and also a smartwatch should be analyzed.

The main target of this application is to provide users with navigation through a sight seeing tour,
which fits their selected criteria and their priorization of points of interests.

NiceTours also provides information about sights on the tour.
